On November 13, 1974, police received a report of a homicide at 112 Ocean Avenue in the Village of Amityville, New York, a sleepy seaside community located on Long Island's South Shore. Once there, the police discovered six members of the DeFeo family -- father, mother and four of their five children -- shot and killed execution style. The surviving son, Ronald ‚ÄúButch‚Äù DeFeo Jr., was eventually charged and tried for the murder of his family and now is serving six concurrent life sentences. Some said a strong supernatural force in the DeFeo home drove Butch DeFeo to kill his family, while others claimed Butch DeFeo killed to receive an inhe

Name: P. Currie
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Most Likely the True Story
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2022
Review: I'm only half way through and the book is dripping with details on the DeFeo family. After watching a few documentaries on the hoax that hoodwinked the World I wanted to know more about the DeFeo family. Life is a series of circumstances, for example. Louise left Ron Sr at least once because of abuse. What if she never returned? Ron Sr, repeated the pattern of abuse from his dad, what if he had been diagnosed with bi polar and got therapy? Ronnie aka Butch isn't innocent, but he wasn't the mastermind. The corruption in the police dept with prisoner abuse was staggering in the 70s! This book is a must read if you have more than a passing interest in Amityville Horror.

Title: a refreshing look at a catholic family tragedy
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2021
Review: a comprehensive look at a dysfunctional family ends in a catastrophic disaster. little known details of the junior's secret marriage. disheartening tale of children wiped off of face of the earth before even learning of life. there was the reaching out to the church, with a predictable ineffectiveness.

Title: Not unbiased at all - very disappointed
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2013
Review: I was extremely disappointed in this book. It seemed that the author just wanted to make a name for himself by presenting a far-fetched scenario. The book was not unbiased at all. I find it reprensible that it accused a family member as an accomplice, as this family member was shot that night. This person is not here to defend herself against allegations, considering she was murdered! The fact that Ronald DeFeo said that this family member was involved is very far from proof, as he has changed his story many times. Save your money for a better book!

Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2016
Review: This book was so terrible. I read first two chapters and threw it away. The information was presented as facts on the reporting of a woman who didn't even know the family. Every time it said "Geraldine was told..." I cringed. The writing is terrible and the typos ridiculous. 20 bucks I'll never get back.

Title: Very believable narrative
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2013
Review: After I read "The Night the DeFeos Died," I became more persuaded that 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, New York was/is just a house, no more. All the folklore of its being haunted, built on an Indian burial ground, possessed of evil spirits is pure American sensationalism. The author has researched the psychology of the family dynamics and guides the reader through a logical cause/effect pattern that brought on the deaths of the family, which is completely contrary to the notion that the eldest son was possessed by evil spirits when he methodically shot and killed his father, mother, two sisters and two brothers. In fact, the older of the two sisters had a part in the crime. If you want to know the details of the real truth, grab this one. If you would rather believe in myths and evil spirits, read "Murder in Amityville" or "The Amityville Horror." Both are fiction.
